# Explore TMDb data

This data set contains metadata (such as title, director, keywords, revenue and user ratings) on around 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). The data are originally from Kaggle but were cleaned before they were provided for this project. Here, we will investigate the relationship between average vote scores and various other variables in the data set. vote_average will be our dependent variable and we will explore genre, budget for the movie, and time of release as independent variables.
